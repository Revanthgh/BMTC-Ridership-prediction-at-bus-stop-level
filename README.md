# BMTC-Ridership-prediction-at-bus-stop-level
The most important of  electronic ticketing; not because it makes things easier for the conductor or passenger, but because it results in a gold mine of data,that can go a long way in solving the cityâ€™s transport problems.Ticketing data in-principle is used by transport corporations (transcos) to identify how many tickets were sold, how many passengers boarded, and what denomination tickets they purchased. In the older, punched ticket system used by BMTC once tickets were sold, conductors would log the serial number of the ticket on top of the bundle at fixed intervals. The difference in serial numbers would indicate the number of tickets sold. However, data such which stage the passenger travelled would be unavailable. Two passengers travelling the same distance but at different points would pay the same. E-ticketing solves that issue to a great extent. It logs the bus stop where the passenger boarded and disembarked, how many passengers travelled on which stage and more. Further, with smart cards, even passes can be tracked, thus giving the operator a clearer picture of the total passenger count.
